# EDA and Clustering on the user's top tracks.

Spotify shares a playlist of the top tracks a user listened to in a year. This data is collected using the Spotify Web API. Performed exploratory data analysis and segmented the user’s top tracks across the years and identified clusters based on track’s attributes.

Implemented KMeans, Agglomerative, GMM and Spectral Clustering algorithms on the dataset and visualized the clusters formed using Seaborn, Plotly and Matplotlib.

Fine-tuned the models using Elbow Graph, Silhouette Scores, AIC and BIC Curves to determine the number of clusters.
